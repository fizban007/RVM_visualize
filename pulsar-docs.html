    <h2 id="pulsars">Pulsars</h2>
    <p>At the end of their lives (as their nuclear fuel runs out), stars can
      take different paths depending on their mass:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Smallest stars, brown or red dwarfs, die off very slowly, becoming
        more and more dim</li>
      <li>Average stars, like our sun, often grow to being a red giant, then
        collapse into a nebula with a white dwarf in its center</li>
      <li>Massive stars are where it really gets interesting. These grow into
        supergiants then explode in supernovas, leaving either a neutron star
        (the case where mass wins-- the star is held together with degeneracy
        pressure) or a black hole (the case where gravity wins).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Pulsars, or rotating neutron stars, are some of the most extreme
      objects in the universe. They are incredibly dense and have extremely
      hot spots, and they rotate unbelivably fast. They are also extremely
      strong magnets, making for an interesting object of study.</p>
    <p><img src="image.png" alt="Alt text" /> <em>Vela Pusar Jet, Chandra
      X-ray Observatory</em></p>
    <p>Pulsars have long beams coming out of their magnetic poles, mostly
      composed of radio emissions. As a result of their fast spinning, we can
      observe these beams every time they are momentarily oriented towards us,
      creating a lighthouse effect. The graph below illustrates one of these
      radiation peaks seen once every rotation.</p>
    <p><img src="image-6.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
    <p><em>Johnston, S. and Kerr, M. (2018). Polarimetry of 600 pulsars from
      observations at 1.4 GHz with the Parkes radio telescope.</em></p>
    <h2 id="rotating-vector-model">Rotating Vector Model</h2>
    <p>We can approxiamte the magnetic field of a neutron star to that of a
      dipole.</p>
    <p><img src="image-5.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
    <p>It is important to note that this model works best on slow spinning
      pulsars (rather than millisecond pulsars, for example). Although it
      works well near the surface, this model also becomes less accurate
      further from the pulsar, as the magentic field lines would need a
      velocity near that of the speed of light to co-rotate with the pulsar.
      The reason for this is that the tangential velocity is equal to the
      product of the angular velocity and the radius from the pulsar's center,
      so as distance (radius) from the pulsar increases, so does the
      tangential velocity. However, since this speed cannot exceed that of
      light, the field lines drag behind, creating a spiral shape.</p>
    <p>The polarization vectors point in the direction of the electric field
      of the EM wave (so perpendicular to their propagation). These are
      depicted in the simulation as arrows on the plane of magnetic field.
      They are changed due to the magnetic field, which acts as follows:
      particles that emit radiation have to follow the magnetic field,
      limiting the direction of polarization either in the plane (o-mode) or
      perpendicular (x-mode) to the plane of the magnetic field.</p>
    <p>Radhakrishnan and Cooke (1969) first brought to light this periodic
      change in polarization angle (PA), which we can plot using the Rotating
      Vector Model (RVM) explained above.</p>
    <h2 id="creation-of-the-visualization">Creation of the
      visualization</h2>
    <p>This visualizations is created using JavaScript, specifically making
      use of Three.js, which is a library that allows for the visualization of
      3D objects in a browser. It also makes use of WebGLPlot to make
      real-time dynamic plots.</p>
    <h3 id="field-lines">Field Lines</h3>
    <p>As we can see, the magnetic field lines emanate radially out of both
      magnetic poles, modeled after a magnetic dipole.</p>
    <h3 id="magnetic-and-rotation-axes">Magnetic and Rotation Axes</h3>
    <p>Two axes slice through the pulsar, one being its rotational axis
      (which is always assumed to be perfectly vertical), the other being its
      magnetic axis. This latter axis intersects both magnetic poles, as we
      can observe, are the origins of the magnetic field lines.</p>
    <p>It is possible to change the orientation of the magnetic axis by
      changing the dipole angle. The beam along this axis will follow its
      orientation, modeled by a cone with plasma-like texture.</p>
    <p>All these elements can then rotate with a custom rotation speed. High
      rotation speeds will simulate actual pulsar behavior and demonstrate the
      previously described lighthouse effect.</p>
    <h2 id="polarization-angle-plot">Polarization Angle Plot</h2>
    <p>Created using WebGLPlot, the PA plot follows the observer with a red
      vertical line as they rotate the pulsar. It also follows the automatic
      rotation of the star. The plot has a bit of a static effect to
      illustrate it as being dynamic. A "lock observer" option has been added
      to better allow the correlation between vector orientation and the
      resulting plot to be understood.</p>
    <p><span
         class="math display">$$\psi=\arctan\left(\frac{\sin\theta\sin\phi}{\cos\chi\sin\theta\cos\phi-\sin\chi\cos\theta}\right)$$</span></p>
    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="math inline"><em>θ</em></span> is the dipole angle
        (relative to the axis of rotation)</li>
      <li><span class="math inline"><em>χ</em></span> is the observer angle,
        determining the circle swept by the line of sight</li>
      <li><span class="math inline"><em>ϕ</em></span> is the phase angle,
        tracking where we are in a revolution</li>
      <li><span class="math inline"><em>ψ</em></span> is the resulting
        polarization angle</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="interpretations">Interpretations</h3>
    <p>The PA graph reaches its max/mins when the PA is $-\pi/2$ or $\pi/2$,
      corresponding to when the vectors appear tangent to the circle swept by
      the line of sight. This happens at different times depending on which mode
      was chosen:
      <code>o-mode</code> will show vectors as parallel to the magnetic field
      plane, whereas <code>x-mode</code> will show them as perpendicular. The
      opposite is true for when the plot is at 0.</p>
    <p>The plot will have the greastest slope when the change in PA is
      greatest</p>
    <p><img src="image-2.png" alt="Alt text" /> <em>Above shows the
      transition period between two extremas on the plot with a dramatic
      change in between. We can understand this geometrically: the vector
      pointing straight down during the maximum change actually appears to
      have a polarization angle of 0 because it is perpendicular to the circle
      swept by the line of sight, whereas the ones around it are almost
      orthogonal.</em></p>
    <h4 id="limits-of-the-arctan-function"><em>Limits of the arctan
      function</em></h4>
    <p>The use of the arctan function to model the change in PA entrains
      some mathematic subtleties.</p>
    <p>The most important of these is caused by the fact that arctan will
      always return an angle between <span
                                       class="math inline">−<em>π</em>/2</span> and <span
                                                                                        class="math inline"><em>π</em>/2</span>, meaning that once these angles
      are outside these bounds, they will jump back down or up to being inside
      these values, basically like taking a modulus.</p>
    <p>This has the effect of making vectors that are orthogonal to the
      circle swept by line of sight but in opposite directions actually appear
      to both have a PA of 0. This also causes a discontinuity different than
      the dramatic shift (which really represents a quick PA change). We
      observe this discontinuity when the dipole angle becomes larger than the
      observer angle, as the PA function's denominator changes sign.</p>
    <p><img src="image-4.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>
    <p><em>The example above shows the 90 degree jumps in polarization due
      both to the orientation of vectors as well as the arctangent.</em></p>
    <h3 id="comparison-to-reality">Comparison to reality</h3>
    <p>In reality, there really is a change in PA that follows the RVM.
      However, we can only really observe this change when the neutron star's
      beam is facing us. During that short moment, we observe a discontinuity
      similar to one from our PA plot.</p>

    <p><em>The lower part of the figure shows the integrated profile in
      total intensity (black), linear polarization (red) and circular
      polarization (blue). As we can see here, it is always true that the
      greatest change in polarization happens at a spike of radiation, when
      the star's beam faces Earth.</em></p>
